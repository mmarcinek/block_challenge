My first React Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project also dependens on [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) and
[Materail-UI Scrollable Tabs](https://github.com/STORIS/material-ui-scrollable-tabs) for Tabbed Navigation.

If you clone this repository, run `npm install` to be sure to get all dependency packages.
Running `npm start` will spin up a `localhost:3000` server.
